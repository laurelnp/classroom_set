Software used:
- MUSCLE- to align coding regions as well as non-coding genes. 
- RAxML- to use a GTR+G substitution model in a partitioned maximum likelihood analysis. 
- BEAST- estimate divergence times using a UCLN model. 
- LogCombined- combine resulting trees and log files from 5 BEAST runs. 
- Tracer- assess convergence of model parameter values and estimated node heights to their optimal posterior distributions 
- TreeAnnotator- summarize posterior probability density of combined trees and log files as a maximum clade credibility tree. 
- R packages- APE, GEIGER, and LASER â€“ for diversification rate analyses. 

Data:
Isolated DNA from tissue biopsies from 83 notothenioid species.
